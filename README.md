# I Like Turtles

This repo is for [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) scripts, mainly for those wanting to
automate activities with the highly-useful turtles. They will contain
scripts found online or authored by people here. Credit will be given
where needed, and all licenses will be followed properly.

The goal here is to have a central place for useful scripts. Enjoy!
